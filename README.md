# EAAT4-Project
All files needed to generate graphs are available as supplementary data files.

To load the datasets, we read the relevant excel or csv files (for each dataset see the relevant folder).
Actual analysis of the original data (as .ABF files, or other) is not available.
At (reasonable) request, we can supply the original data files for the desired dataset.

For further questions about code or data, e-mail s.voerman@erasmusmc.nl
(sorry about the mess)
