Analysis of the plasticity data.

Original class used in analysis of .ABF files can be found in base.py. Original files can be requested. Base also contains basic statistical tests and graphing.

The excel sheets provided as supplementary data contain data averaged per minute per cell. A function has been added to import the data from these excel sheets, which
can then be used to graph.

complex_spike_analysis.py is redundant, as it is now integrated into base.py, however it gives a far clearer view of how the analysis of the CS works.
