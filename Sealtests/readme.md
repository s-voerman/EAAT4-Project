Analysis of seal tests. 10 mV deflection of membrane voltage (from -65) for 100 ms.

Analysis of mEPSC/IPSC seals were combined, altough they can be seperated.
- seal_processing.py produces excel output (same as supplementary data) from original .ABF files and metadata.
- seal_plotting.py takes the output from seal_processing.py and makes graphs + stats

Analysis of seals for plasticity data was completed alongside plasticity data, see EAAT4-Project/Plasticty.
